# Leapp Elevate Rocky 8 Helper - Version r82r9

## Overview
Boilerplate BASH wrapper script for upgrading Rocky Linux 8 to Rocky Linux 9 via Leapp ELevate.

Alma Linux ELevate documentation can be found [here](https://almalinux.org/elevate/) <br>

**IMPORTANT** <br>
This script should be considered the _basis_ for it's own work effort and not a complete script in and of itself. <br>
It may be possible to run the script as is and successfully upgrade a server to Rocky 9, but there will likely need to be additional adjustments. <br>
Take a snapshot before using! No warranties, ymmv. <br>
